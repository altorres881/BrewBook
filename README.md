1. install Node.js
   https://nodejs.org/en/download/
    (used instructions to install through cmd)

2. in /backend, typed npm init -y and it created package.json

3. still in /backend, run:
      - npm install
      - npm start
      - (if that doesnt work, npm run build)?

      - enter user and pass, and it should return a message saying its running on localhost:4000
      - KEEP THIS TERMINAL OPEN
4. Open a new terminal, cd into /frontend
   - npm run build
   - npm run dev
   - Ctrl+click on the link that is returned
